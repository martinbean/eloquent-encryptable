# Eloquent Encryptable trait
Adds encryptable attributes to Eloquent models, for storing sensitive data, in Laravel 6.x and 7.x applications.

**NOTE:** If you are using Laravel 8.x, you **DO NOT NEED** this package. Laravel offers a native `encrypted` cast that works on strings, collections, and objects. For more information, see [laravel.com/docs/8.x/eloquent-mutators#attribute-casting][2]

## Usage
Simply add the trait to your Eloquent model, and define an array of attributes
whose values should be encrypted in your database in an `$encryptable` property:

```php
<?php

namespace App;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use MartinBean\Eloquent\Encryptable;

class Patient extends Model
{
    use Encryptable;

    protected $encryptable = [
        'medical_conditions',
        'medical_notes',
        'allergies_and_reactions',
        'medications',
        'blood_type',
        'is_organ_donor',
        'emergency_contact_id',
    ];
}
```

You can retrieve these attributes as normal and theyâ€™ll be decrypted:

```php
$medical_conditions = $patient->medical_conditions;
```
